A small piece of code to debug bootstrap responsive layouts

This is only a stupid piece of code to debug responsive layouts based on bootstrap framework.
The script add a simple overlay box with basic info that update on resize and scroll events:
  break-point:	bootstrap break point @screen-lg, @screen-md, @screen-sm, @screen-xs
  width:	window.width()
  height:	window.height()
  offsetTop:	window.offsetTop()
